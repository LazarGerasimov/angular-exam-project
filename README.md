The app works as a gallery and supports several functionalities: 

Registering and logging users.

Guests have access to the home page and the three latest photos uploaded by the registered users. A quick link is provided for logging in to unlock the full content.

Registered users have access to the full content of the website. Their personal uploads, content and profile information is stored in the profile tab.

Users can upload their own photos, add title, description, price and attach a link for their photos. The app supports editing/deleting functionality. Upon creation/destruction of a personal photo, user is redirected back to their profile tab. In case the user has not added any photos yet, there is a quick link provided in the profile tab.
